# Machine Learning

As lecturer of machine learning concept, I use this repository to support my students (and myself) during the lectures. You can find all kind of thing in this repository. Most likely not finished and only used for education purposes. As the machine learning class starts in the year 2020, it start empty and will be filled with all kinds of examples. ANyway, good luck and enjoy learning machine learning. A rapid area under fast development.
