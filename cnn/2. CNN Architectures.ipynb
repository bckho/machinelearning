    "In the mean time, a lot of CNN architectures have been proposed. Within this notebook we are going to study the different CNN architectures. Note that real CNN architectures are really large networks. Training takes a lot of time. You really need a GPU to do this. In fact, you really need a lot of GPU to train these. Make sure you use the CoLab servers to get the appropiate GPU power to train your objects.\n",

    "## A first note\n",
    "When you want to perform object detection. The best approach is to select an existing CNN architecture that is created to do a similar thing as your problem. Try to train this \"existing\" network to train your objects. It is even possible to only train the neural network with a fixed convolutional neural network."

    "## R-CNN (Regional Convolutional Neural Network)\n",
    "R-CNN is an improvement of the old algorithms like SIFT and started in 2014. The picture below shows the architecture of R-CNN. The first stage is to extract region proposals and the second stage is to classify these proposals. \n",
    "<img src=\"architectures/R-CNN.png\"/>\n",
    "When you would like to detect multiple objects, you need to find objects in the image and try to classify these objects with a neural network. R-CNN does this by propose around 2.000 regions where objects could exists and classify all these regions using the fully connected neural network. The algorithm **selective search** is used to provide these regions to the network. It scans the images with windows with various scales and tries to look for adjacent pixels that shares colors and textures."

    "The main advantage is the the convolutional layer is not used for each regions. Instead, the convolutional layer is extracting the features of the image one time. These features are than used for the detection with a fully connected network for each region. In this case, ROI means regions of interest which is extracted from the feature map. This is done by an algorithm."
