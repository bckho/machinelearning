# Artificial Neural Networks - ANN
Within this part of the repo, I show the details of an artificial neural network. Building the network up from scratch. Show how to calculate the outputs of the network: Forward propagation. Back propagation and the gradient descent algorithm is used to calculate the costs and update the weights and biases of the network.

## Jupyter notebooks
In the root of this repo, you find Jupyter notebook that describe some theory around artificial neural networks and show how the individuel parts could be implemented in Python.

## Python
Within the Python directory, you can find all the scripts that show the implementation of ANN related theory. It helps you to understand the underlying theory and techniques of artificial neural networks.
