# Artificial Neural Networks - ANN
Within this part of the repo, I show the details of an artificial neural network. Building the network up from scratch. Show how to calculate the outputs of the network: Forward propagation. Back propagation and the gradient descent algorithm is used to calculate the costs and update the weights and biases of the network.

## Jupyter notebooks
In the root of this repo, you find Jupyter notebook that describe some theory around artificial neural networks and show how the individuel parts could be implemented in Python.

## Python
Within the Python directory, you can find all the scripts that show the implementation of ANN related theory. It helps you to understand the underlying theory and techniques of artificial neural networks.

## Were to start?
I have created 5 Jupyter notebooks that discusses in steps each subject of an artificial neural network. When you would like to study the theory, you should follow the order of these notebooks. I discuss the following aspects in the notebooks:
1. Discussing the node or artificial neuron or perceptron. Besides the theory, also how to implement the perceptron in Python is shown.
2. This notebook zooms into how to calculate ANN with the use of linear algebra: matrices and vectors. Also how this could be done in Python is shown.
3. Within this notebook a ANN class is created from scratch. It shows how to implement it in Python. Forward propagation is implemented and it is possible to configure the hidden layers and their activation functions.
4. How neural network learn is explained: back propagation together with gradient descent. It discusses the theory behind backpropagation in all the steps. After understanding this notebook, you should be able to implement this in Python.
5. The ANN of notebook 3 is extended with back propagation, so it is possible to learn from a given sample.
